## Supervised Learning
You give the machine examples to learn from, that includes the "right answers".

Types of supervised learning:
- **Regression;** predicts a **number**, infinitely many possible outputs (Housing prices)
- **Classification:** predicts categories, like whether a picture is a dog or a cat, small number of possible outputs
## Unsupervised Learning
Find something interesting in unlabeled data, figured all by yourself the labels (outputs). The algorithm tries to identify a pattern in data

- **Clustering:** places the unlabeled data into differents clusters, like groups / categories. With a dataset, the algorithm tries to group similar things in the same category.
- **Anomaly Detection:** find unusual data points
- **Dimensionality reduction:** compress data using fewer numbers
