### Blockchain 
- é uma estrutura de banco de dados que armazena informações de forma descentralizada e inteligente. 
- Formado por blocos de dados encadeados, cada um contendo informações de transacoes que sao autenticadas pela propria rede.
1. **Bitcoin**: o bitcoin usa o blockchain para **armazena e controlar as transacoes,** validando.
	Por exemplo quando alguém envia bitcoin, cria-se um novo bloco. Esse bloco é verificado pela rede de PC que ao resolverem problemas complexos validam o bloco, isso é feito pelos mineradores e como recompensa ganham fraçoes de bitcoin.


To transfer Bitcoin to another person, you follow a series of steps that utilize the Bitcoin network and blockchain technology. Here’s a simplified overview of how a Bitcoin transaction works:

1. **Wallet Setup**: You need a Bitcoin wallet, which can be a software wallet (on your computer or mobile device) or a hardware wallet. The wallet generates a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key (your address, where others can send you Bitcoin) and a private key (which you use to sign transactions).
    
2. **Initiating a Transaction**:
    
    - Open your wallet and select the option to send Bitcoin.
    - Enter the recipient's public address (Bitcoin address) and the amount of Bitcoin you wish to send.
    - Your wallet will compile this information into a transaction.
    - 
3. **Signing the Transaction**:
    
    - To authorize the transaction, you need to sign it with your private key. This step proves that you own the Bitcoin and have the right to send it.
4. **Broadcasting the Transaction**:
    
    - Once signed, your wallet broadcasts the transaction to the Bitcoin network. The transaction is sent to various nodes (computers) that maintain the Bitcoin ledger.
5. **Verification**:
    
    - Miners on the network validate the transaction by checking that the sender has enough balance and that the transaction follows Bitcoin's rules.
6. **Inclusion in a Block**:
    
    - Valid transactions are grouped into blocks. Miners compete to solve a complex mathematical problem (proof of work) to add a new block to the blockchain.
7. **Confirmation**:
    
    - Once the block containing your transaction is added to the blockchain, the transaction is considered confirmed. Depending on the network's congestion, it may take a few minutes to several hours to receive the required confirmations.
8. **Completion**:
    
    - Once confirmed, the recipient can see the received Bitcoin in their own wallet. The transaction details (amount, sender, recipient address, and timestamp) are publicly available on the blockchain, providing transparency.

Remember, Bitcoin transactions can incur fees and it’s essential to double-check all details before confirming the transaction, as they cannot be reversed once completed. Would you like to know more about any specific part of this process?
